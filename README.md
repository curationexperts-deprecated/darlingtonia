# Darlingtonia

***
**DEPRECATION NOTICE:** Darlingtonia is getting a new name and a new focus. Darlingtonia started as a command line importer tool, but in recent projects we have added UI that allows users to import directly form the Hyrax dashboard. To reflect this and other changes our importer gem will now be called [**Zizia**](https://github.com/curationexperts/zizia). Accordingly, we are depreciating Darlingtonia and all future development will be done on [**Zizia**](https://github.com/curationexperts/zizia). Moving forward, [**Zizia**](https://github.com/curationexperts/zizia) will not be backward compatible with Darlingtonia. The code for Darlingtonia will remain available here, but no future development will be occurring.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlingtonia_californica"><em>Darlingtonia californica</em></a>,
also called the California pitcher plant, cobra lily, or cobra plant, is a species of carnivorous plant, the sole member of the genus <i>Darlingtonia</i> in the family <i>Sarraceniaceae</i>. It is native to Northern California and Oregon growing in bogs and seeps with cold running water.

## Usage

In your project's `Gemfile`, add: `gem 'darlingtonia'`, then run `bundle install`.

To do a basic Hyrax import, first ensure that a [work type is registered](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/samvera/hyrax/Hyrax/Configuration#register_curation_concern-instance_method)
with your `Hyrax` application. Then write a class like this:

```ruby
require 'darlingtonia'

class MyImporter
  def initialize(csv_file)
    @csv_file = csv_file
    raise "Cannot find expected input file #{csv_file}" unless File.exist?(csv_file)
  end

  def import
    attrs = {
      collection_id: collection_id,     # pass a collection id to the record importer and all records will be added to that collection
      depositor_id: depositor_id,       # pass a Hyrax user_key here and that Hyrax user will own all objects created during this import
      deduplication_field: 'identifier' # pass a field with a persistent identifier (e.g., ARK) and it will check to see if a record with that identifier already     
    }                                   # exists, update its metadata if so, and only if it doesn't find a record with that identifier will it make a new object.

    file = File.open(@csv_file)
    parser = Darlingtonia::CsvParser.new(file: file)
    record_importer = Darlingtonia::HyraxRecordImporter.new(attributes: attrs)
    Darlingtonia::Importer.new(parser: parser, record_importer: record_importer).import
    file.close # unless a block is passed to File.open, the file must be explicitly closed
  end
end
```

You can find [an example csv file for import to Hyrax](https://github.com/curationexperts/darlingtonia/blob/master/spec/fixtures/hyrax/example.csv) in the fixtures directory. Files for attachment should have the filename in a column
with a heading of `files`, and the location of the files should be specified via an
environment variables called `IMPORT_PATH`. If `IMPORT_PATH` is not set, `HyraxRecordImporter` will look in `/opt/data` by default.

## Customizing
To input any kind of file other than CSV, you need to provide a `Parser` (out of the box, we support simple CSV import with `CsvParser`). We will be writing guides about
how to support custom mappers (for metadata outside of Hyrax's core and basic metadata fields).

This software is primarily intended for use in a [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) project.
However, its dependency on `hyrax` is kept strictly optional so most of its code can be reused to
good effect elsewhere. Note: As of release 2.0, `HyraxBasicMetadataMapper` will be the default mapper.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/curationexperts/darlingtonia
cd darlingtonia

bundle install
bundle exec rake ci
```

### RSpec Support

This gem ships with RSpec shared examples and other support tools intended to ease testing and ensure
interoperability of client code. These can be included by adding `require 'darlingtonia/spec'` to a
`spec_helper.rb` or `rails_helper.rb` file in your application's test suite.
